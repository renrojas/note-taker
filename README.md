# Note Taker

## Description
The creation of this application is for the user to be able to write and save notes to keep track of any thoughts or tasks they need to complete. This application makes it easier for any user to manage their notes all in one place instead of having sticky notes all over the place. One thing I learned while working on this application was using uuuidv4 to create a unique id for each note when it is saved.

To add a note, you can click on the '+' button on the top right and fill out the grayed out fields to add a note title and and note text. Once finished click on the white floppy disk on the top right of the page to save the note.
